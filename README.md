# SuperRes AI: Image Super-Resolution using Machine Learning

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

**SuperRes AI** is a machine learning-based system developed for the **CSE445 Machine Learning** course at **North South University**. The project focuses on restoring high-quality images from significantly degraded ones using machine learning models trained on real image data.

## üìå Project Overview
</div>
The aim of this project is to develop a **Super-Resolution Image Enhancement System** using **deep learning**, where low-resolution images are restored to near-original quality through model inference. 

This is accomplished by:
- **Collecting and degrading images**
- **Training a super-resolution model**
- **Evaluating with metrics like PSNR and SSIM**
- **Generating side-by-side comparisons for visual verification**

## üîç Key Features

</div>

- **Low-Resolution Simulation**: Original images are degraded through blurring and downsampling.
- **Image Super-Resolution**: A deep learning model learns to reconstruct high-resolution images.
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports switching between baseline (SRCNN) and advanced models (e.g., ESPCN).
- **Performance Evaluation**: Automated calculation of PSNR, SSIM, and visual results.
